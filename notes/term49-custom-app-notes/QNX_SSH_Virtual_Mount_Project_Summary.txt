QNX SSH Virtual Mount Project - Complete Summary
==================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
Developed a complete SSH-based file management system for QNX (BlackBerry 10) 
devices that works around the operating system's security restrictions while 
providing full bidirectional file transfer capabilities.

THE PROBLEM
===========
• Need to access remote files from QNX devices over SSH
• QNX security restrictions prevent regular users from creating resource managers
• Limited libraries available in the QNX environment
• Traditional SSHFS requires privileges that aren't available to regular users
• Need for multiple simultaneous connections to different servers

INITIAL APPROACH - Resource Manager
===================================
Started with a traditional QNX resource manager approach:
- Attempted to create a true filesystem using resmgr_attach()
- Would have appeared as a real mounted filesystem in QNX
- Failed due to "Operation not permitted" errors
- QNX restricts resource manager creation to privileged processes only

BREAKTHROUGH - Virtual Mount System
===================================
Developed an innovative "virtual mount" approach that:
- Creates local directory structures that mirror remote filesystems
- Uses SSH commands on-demand rather than persistent connections
- Works entirely in user space without special privileges
- Provides filesystem-like experience without actual mounting

PROJECT EVOLUTION
==================

Version 1: Basic SSH File Tool (qnx-sshfs-tool)
-----------------------------------------------
• Simple command-line tool for individual SSH operations
• Manual SSH key or password authentication
• Basic file download/upload capabilities
• Proof of concept for SSH connectivity

Version 2: Virtual Mount with Caching (qnx-mount-ssh)
-----------------------------------------------------
• Introduced directory listing caching
• Created local file structure mirrors
• Added basic script generation for file operations
• Fixed SSH connection testing

Version 3: Enhanced with Upload Support (qnx-mount-upload)
----------------------------------------------------------
• Added comprehensive upload functionality
• Bidirectional file transfer (download + upload)
• Bulk sync operations
• Interactive file manager interface
• Password caching with basic encryption

Version 4: Smart Auto-naming (qnx-mount-smart) - FINAL
------------------------------------------------------
• Auto-generates unique directory names based on connection details
• Supports multiple simultaneous connections
• Intelligent conflict resolution for existing directories
• QNX compatibility fixes (removed Linux-specific code)
• Comprehensive management tools

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES OVERCOME
=============================

1. QNX Resource Manager Restrictions
   Solution: Virtual mount system using local directories

2. Password Authentication Issues  
   Solution: Integrated sshpass for automated password handling

3. Multiple Connection Management
   Solution: Auto-generated directory names with timestamps

4. QNX Compatibility Issues
   - d_type not available in QNX dirent structure
   - Different printf format requirements
   - Solution: Used stat() calls and proper type casting

5. Security for Password Storage
   Solution: Simple XOR obfuscation for cached passwords

FINAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
============================

Core Architecture:
------------------
• Written in C for maximum QNX compatibility
• Uses standard POSIX libraries only
• Leverages SSH/SCP commands via system() calls
• Creates complete local directory structures

Key Features:
-------------
• Auto-generated mount directories: host_port_path_timestamp format
• Password caching with basic encryption
• Multiple simultaneous connections
• Full bidirectional file transfer
• Directory listing with file metadata
• Script-based file operations
• Conflict resolution for existing mounts

Directory Structure Created:
---------------------------
mount_directory/
├── mount-info.txt          # Connection metadata
├── directory.listing       # Raw remote directory output
├── files/                  # Individual file information
│   ├── filename1.info     # Metadata for each remote file
│   └── filename2.info
├── list.sh                 # Pretty directory listing
├── download.sh             # File download script
├── upload.sh               # File upload script
└── .ssh_cache             # Encrypted password cache

Smart Directory Naming Examples:
-------------------------------
• berrystore_sw7ft_com_59721_httpdocs_0623_1445
• server_22_webroot_0623_1446  
• myhost_2222_api_0623_1447

USAGE PATTERNS
==============

Basic Connection:
./qnx-mount-smart -p 59721 user@server.com:remote/path

Auto-generated Directory:
./qnx-mount-smart user@server.com:web
# Creates: server_com_web_0623_1445/

Multiple Connections:
./qnx-mount-smart user1@server1.com:web
./qnx-mount-smart user2@server2.com:api  
./qnx-mount-smart -p 2222 user3@server3.com:data

List All Mounts:
./qnx-mount-smart -l

File Operations:
cd server_com_web_0623_1445/
./list.sh                    # View remote files
./download.sh index.php      # Download file
./upload.sh myfile.txt       # Upload file

1. Working with QNX Constraints:
   - Security restrictions require creative solutions
   - Virtual approaches can be as effective as direct system integration
   - User-space solutions are often more portable and maintainable

2. SSH Integration:
   - System command approach more reliable than library integration
   - Password handling requires careful security consideration
   - Connection testing essential for robust operation

3. Multi-connection Architecture:
   - Unique naming prevents conflicts
   - Auto-generation improves user experience
   - Metadata preservation enables rich functionality

4. QNX Development:
   - Platform-specific compatibility testing crucial
   - Standard POSIX compliance not always sufficient
   - Cross-compilation workflow must be thoroughly tested
